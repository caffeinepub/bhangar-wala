  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to backend/main.mo (Motoko canister code), frontend page/component files (via frontend-file-summaries.txt), frontend/public/sw.js (service worker), and project_state.json. These changes appear to be feature/bug-fix work rather than mainnet deployment configuration. There is no evidence of deployment configuration files (dfx.json mainnet network settings, canister IDs for mainnet, deploy scripts, CI/CD pipeline changes, or any ic-deployment artifacts) being added or modified. The service worker update (sw.js) partially addresses the PWA manifest/service worker requirement, but the core deployment infrastructure changes are absent.",
