  "summary": "The diff implements all five requirements. REQ-57 (Login screen with phone OTP flow) is restored in Login.tsx with country code selector defaulting to +91, Send OTP button, terms & conditions checkbox, and no II-related UI. REQ-58 (OTP Verification page) is restored in OtpVerification.tsx with 6 digit inputs, 60-second timer, Resend OTP button, Verify button, localStorage session storage, and navigation logic. REQ-59 (Profile Setup) reads phone from localStorage auth_session and requires the phone field. REQ-60 (Splash) uses localStorage session detection. REQ-61 (Profile logout) clears localStorage without II logout. However, the helper hint text in OtpVerification.tsx does not exactly match the required text, and phone is stored in sessionStorage rather than component state in Login.tsx.",

      "reason": "Login.tsx stores the phone in sessionStorage.setItem('otp_phone', fullPhone) rather than component state as specified by the requirement.
